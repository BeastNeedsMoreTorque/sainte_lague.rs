# sainte_lague

A rust implementation of the **[Sainte-Laguë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webster/Sainte-Lagu%C3%AB_method)** (also known as **Webster** or **Schepers**) method. Parliament seat allocation algorithm used in multiple countries such as Germany, Latvia, New Zealand etc…

*Attention: Since some countries (like Latvia or Norway) use a modification of the algorithm instead of this vanilla version, you should check your country's electoral legislature. Furthermore, I don't take any responsibility for the accuracy of the calculated numbers, even though I'm pretty confident with my implementation.*
